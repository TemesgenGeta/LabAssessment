                <p>Hi friends:</p>
                <p>I am Temesgen, I am expert <strong>web</strong> developer who has been working
                     on web since <em>14</em></em14> years old. <br> I am passionate about working  in different
                      types of programming language such as python, <br> java, c++, csharp and also script language.

                <article id = "articles">
                    <p>
                        Let me tell you about css units first to remind you and then I will tell you my own argument. There are two types of css
                        units: relative and absolute units. Relative units are related to the viewport or font size of an element whereas absolute units
                        are always constant or the same regardless of viewport or font size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            One of the absolute units is px which is common for bordering. 
                            If I set one value of px for elements, every element will have 
                            the same value. For instance, let me say my laptop size is 1200 * 700
                            pixels, which mean that 1200px value of element will fit the width of
                            laptop screen. If I use 1300px of element, it can’t fit with the screen, 
                            so it is necessary to scroll horizontally. You may not satisfy the visitor’s
                            screen. This is what the limitation of using px. Therefore relative units are
                            necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Some of relative units are em and rem which are common for margin/padding and font size
                            and font size respectively. Em is relative to font size of the element whereas rem is relative to the default 
                            font size instead of the current element’s font size, the default font size of the browser is
                            usually 16px. It is common to use relative size em and rem over pixel because they would make our design more accessible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            In my view, it is better to use relative size to styling the size of an element.
                            Even if the browser is providing zoom feature, using relative size is better.
                            The user should not be bother about how to get the zoom feature of browser, how
                            to use and adjust font display setting. Not only that but also the UI that is
                            appeared using relative size is better than using zoom feature of the browser.
                            If we set a higher default font size, it is not necessary to zoom in browser to
                            able to read the website because relative units would increase to what font size we want. 
                            Therefore, I conclude that using relative size for size styling is responsive and
                            we have to use it.
